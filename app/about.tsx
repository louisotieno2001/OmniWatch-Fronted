      <Text style={styles.text}>
        OmniWatch is a smart guard tracking and monitoring platform designed for
        modern security operations. It enables security companies to monitor
        guards in real time, record patrol routes, and maintain accurate,
        time-stamped movement logs for accountability and reporting.

      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>What OmniWatch Does</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        • Tracks guards’ live GPS locations during active shifts{'\n'}
        • Records patrol trails with precise timestamps{'\n'}
        • Provides supervisors with real-time visibility and alerts{'\n'}
        • Stores historical patrol data for audits and investigations{'\n'}
        • Enhances transparency and trust between guards, clients, and companies

      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>Why OmniWatch Matters</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Traditional patrol supervision relies heavily on manual reporting,
        which is prone to delays and inaccuracies. OmniWatch eliminates guesswork
        by providing verifiable, location-based patrol data. This ensures guards
        are where they are supposed to be — when they are supposed to be there.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>Built for Security Teams</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        OmniWatch is built with security companies, supervisors, and guards in
        mind. The system is lightweight, reliable, and designed to work in
        real-world conditions with minimal user interaction.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>Privacy & Trust</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        We take privacy seriously. Location tracking is active only during
        authorized duty hours, and all data is securely stored and accessible
        only to approved personnel.
